Professionally made, easily accessible. Vangemert has created a simple website that shows off his talent as a designer.

The design of this website is what interests me. The design basically forces you to scroll down to find content, but it is beautifully designed, and still functional.

Having the center of the website as the only place you can access anything is a brilliant design tactic. It forces the visitors to search through the website for what they want instead of having the simple structure of a typical website.

This design is beautiful and obviously custom work. I just wish the picture itself was actually riddled with interactive links; I actually fell like this website is a waste of potential.

 I love the way that the text scrolls over the background picture. His website is a work of art in itself, with its dark colors and masterful photography backing its intelligent and well layered design.
