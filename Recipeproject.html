<br><li>To make the filling&colon; Combine all the filling ingredients&period;</li>

<br><li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees&period; Grease a 12-by-9-inch or 13-by-9-inch baking pan or 15-by-10-inch jelly roll pan&period;</li>

<br><li>Place a sheet of phyllo in the prepared pan and lightly brush with butter&period; Repeat with 7 more sheets&period; Spread with half of the filling&period; Top with 8 more sheets&comma; brushing each with butter&period; Use any torn sheets in the middle layer&period; Spread with the remaining nut mixture and end with a top layer of 8 sheets&comma; continuing to brush each with butter&period; Trim any overhanging edges&period;</li>

<br><li>Using a sharp knife&comma; cut 6 equal lengthwise strips (about 1 3/4 inches wide) through the top layer of pastry&period; Make 1 1/2-inch-wide diagonal cuts across the strips to form diamond shapes&period;</li>
